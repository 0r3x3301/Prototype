# Prototype
 This is a prototype of a new game. In it I want to implement the main mechanics that I will use in the main game. The game will use a 2D view in 3D space.
What needs to be done:
1) Movement system.
2) Allow the player to jump.
3) Climb objects.
4) Crawl on ladders.
5) Crawl through narrow places.
6) Walk stealthily.
7) Carry several small objects.
8) Interact with buttons and switches.
9) Dialogues.
10) Turn corners.
11) Mini games.
